**Darkness** is a simple **Flask API** used to control **NeoPixels** strip connected to **Raspberry Pi**.

>Don't Use! Currently in active development!

## Setup

**Darkness** is currently run as Docker container, you can try it out with commands below.

This runs a container with minimal setup required (Using PWM0 as a method of control).

```bash
docker run --name darkness --cap-add SYS_RAWIO --device /dev/mem --device /dev/vcio -p 5001:8000 rangerdigital/darkness
```

Or in case It doesn't work:

```bash
docker run --name darkness --privileged -p 5001:8000 rangerdigital/darkness
```

>The privileged flag is seriously **insecure**, I wouldn't trust me if I were you!
>
## Usage

**Darkness** is currently in the **development stage** so the whole documentation is incomplete.

For now, the easiest way to try it out is to run **GET** requests against **/state** endpoint,
with **POST** or **PUT** you can update these values to control still ambient light.

```json
{
"hue":  360,
"saturation":  1,
"status":  true,
"value":  1
}
```
You can control NeoPixels with these **HSV** values!
